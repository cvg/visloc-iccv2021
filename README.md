# ETH-MS localization dataset

<img src="assets/logos.svg" width="40%"/>

The [Computer Vision & Geometry Group at ETH Zurich](http://www.cvg.ethz.ch/) and the [Microsoft Mixed Reality & AI Lab Zurich](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/mixed-reality-ai-zurich/) introduce a new dataset for visual localization with a focus on Augmented Reality scenarios. The data covers day & night illumination changes, large indoor & outdoor environments, and different sensor configurations for handheld and head-mounted devices.

This is a preview of a much larger dataset which will be released later. This preview is part of the challenge of the [ICCV 2021 workshop on Long-Term Visual Localization under Changing Conditions](https://sites.google.com/view/ltvl2021/).

## Data

We provide images captured at the HG building of the ETH Zurich campus, both in the main halls and on the sidewalk. This environments is challenging as it exhibits many self-similarities and symmetric structures. The images are split into mapping and query images. The **mapping** images were captured by the 6-camera rig of a NavVis M6 mobile scanner. The **query** images are extracted from sequences recorded months apart by:

- an **iPhone 8 as single images** from the back camera,
- a **HoloLens2 as sets of 4 images** from the rig of 4 tracking cameras.

| Type                  | Sensor                          | Resolution | # images | Date                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Mapping               | NavVis M6, RGB cameras          | 1442x1920  | 6 x 819  | 2021-02-18 (morning)                      |
| Queries: single-image | iPhone 8 ARKit, RGB back camera | 1440x1920  | 300      | 2021-04-29 (day) <br />2021-05-04 (night) |
| Queries: rigs         | HoloLens2, grayscale cameras    | 480x640    | 4 x 300  | 2021-02-18 (morning)                      |

We provide the poses of the mapping images but hold private those of the query images. We however provide intrinsic camera calibrations for all images and relative rig poses of the HoloLens2. We have obfuscated the temporal order of the images to prevent challenge participants from relying on image sequences.

The data is available at the following location in the [Kapture](https://github.com/naver/kapture) format: https://cvg-data.inf.ethz.ch/eth_ms_dataset/iccv2021 The timestamps and camera (or rig) IDs of the single (and rig) queries are listed in the files `queries_single.txt` and `queries_rigs.txt`.

## ICCV 2021 Challenge

The goal of the challenge is to estimate the poses of the single query images (iPhone) and of the camera rigs (HoloLens2) listed in the files `queries_[single|rigs].txt`. Challenge participants are expected to submit a single text file to the evaluation server at [visuallocalization.net](https://www.visuallocalization.net/). Each line of this file corresponds to the pose of one single image or rig in the format:
```
timestamp/camera_or_rig_id qw qx qy qz tx ty tz
```

The pose is expressed as quaternion `qw qx qy qz` and camera translation `tx ty tz` in the COLMAP coordinate system, i.e. **from the world to camera frame**. Here is an example of two poses from the submission file generated by the demo script below:

```
0/cam_phone_0_2 -0.08691328955558617 -0.19368004528425714 0.834072988867356 -0.5091722394231546 16.350978764689117 33.55611563888155 -57.70510693949592
1/hetrig_1 0.0005166642265923816 0.8648426950562507 0.0027338466179127005 -0.5020352297882964 -31.154051098151406 9.907290815759488 58.16937396700082
```
The submission file should be composed of a total of 600 queries.

## Localization demo

We provide a baseline method with [hloc](https://github.com/cvg/Hierarchical-Localization) using SuperPoint+SuperGlue for image matching and NetVLAD for image retrieval. The pipeline estimates absolute poses of the queries using P3P for the single images and a generalized solver GP3P for the camera rigs.

Reauirements:
- Python >= 3.6
- latest commits of [COLMAP](https://colmap.github.io/) and [pycolmap](https://github.com/mihaidusmanu/pycolmap)
- [hloc](https://github.com/cvg/Hierarchical-Localization) and its dependencies
- [kapture](https://github.com/naver/kapture): `pip install kapture`

To download the data and run the demo pipeline:
```
wget https://cvg-data.inf.ethz.ch/eth_ms_dataset/iccv2021/data.zip && unzip data.zip
python3 -m demo.pipeline
```

This will create a submission file in `outputs/netvlad+superpoint+superglue/results.txt` as well as visualizations in `outputs/netvlad+superpoint+superglue/viz/`:

Once submitted to the benchmark, this should roughly give the following recall:
| Method                       | Single-image queries | Rig queries        |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| NetVLAD+SuperPoint+SuperGlue | 41.0 / 51.7 / 57.7   | 70.0 / 74.3 / 75.0 |

for (orientation, distance) thresholds (1°, 10cm) / (2°, 25cm) / (5°, 1m).
